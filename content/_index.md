  - title: "Stability and Community Cohesion"
    content: "Affordable housing helps families establish stable homes within the community. When families can afford to live in a particular area, they are more likely to put down roots, engage in long-term community activities, and build strong social connections. This stability contributes to a sense of community cohesion and fosters a supportive environment for children to grow and develop."
