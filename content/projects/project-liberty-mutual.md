As part of the land development agreement with Greatlands, the Town is interested in pursuing housing development on the eastern parcel of the property for up to 20 units of housing.  A Working Group is to be established to plan for the development of the housing and to establish the steps necessary to move this project to completion.  Funds for this project may come from monies provided for as part of the development agreement with Greatlands, and any other funds the Town may seek to help accomplish this development.
