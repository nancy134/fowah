At the May 2017 Annual Town Meeting, $950,000 was appropriated to the use of the Trust for the purpose of creating affordable homeownership units. Since then, the Trust identified a piece of Town-owned property at the corner of Route 20 and Wellesley Street. 

The Trust has contract with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Boston to build six cohesive and attractive homes that reflect the character of the neighborhood and enable six well-qualified families to own a home in Weston. These units will be permitted under the Local Initiative Program (LIP) of Chapter 40 B.
